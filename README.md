Calculator for linear interpolation of thermodynamic property table values

This is a simple little calculator I made to save me some time when I'm doing thermodynamics homework.
This linearly interpolates values to give you the value you need.

For instance if you need the specific enthalpy at 210K but the property table only has values for 200 and 220K
you can use this calculator to find the specific enthalpy at 210 by entering 200 and 220 for x1 and x2 respectively.
Then you enter in the specific enthalpies at 200 and 220 for y1 and y2 respectively. Then you plug in the last value you know,
in this case 210 for x3, and it will give you the sp. enthalpy at 210!
