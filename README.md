Calculator for linear interpolation of thermodynamic property table values

This is a simple little calculator I made to save me some time when I'm doing thermodynamics homework.
This linearly interpolates values to give you the value you need.

There are two versions of this. The first version I made in C, and it's okay, it does the job.
The second version I made in Python using Tkinter, it opens a little GUI that you can keep reusing.
I definitely like the Python version better but I'm leaving the C one up
